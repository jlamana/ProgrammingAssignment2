## We want to create two funcions to cache potentially time-consuming computations.
## We are going to calculate the invertible of a matrix. If the contents of the matrix
## are not changing, we'll cache the value of the invertible 
## so that when we need it again, it can be looked up in the cache rather than recomputed.

##The makeCacheMatrix function is like a matrix object constructor
##with it we can set and get the value of the matrix and its ivertible.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        m <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                m <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setsolve <- function(solve) m <<- solve
        getsolve <- function() m
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setsolve = setsolve,
             getsolve = getsolve)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the 
## cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        m <- x$getsolve()
        if(!is.null(m)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(m)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        m <- solve(data, ...)
        x$setsolve(m)
        m
}
